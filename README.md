In this project I will be re-creating the home page of google.
The purpose of this project is to gain better mastery of basic tools and skills in HTML and CSS.
I will also get hands on experience building a 'modern' website, which will include much trial and error.
While working on the page, I will be utilizing dev tools to figure out new ways to accomplish objectives, and I will use git to keep copies of my work, so looking back I can see what steps I took to reach the objective.
